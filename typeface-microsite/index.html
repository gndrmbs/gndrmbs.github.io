  <section class="inspiration-description">
    <p class="inspiration-description">Bent is a sculptural display typeface that explores distortion, imbalance,
        and fragmentation. Inspired by the torqued steel forms of Richard Serra
        and the angular chaos of Frank Gehry's architecture, Bent twists traditional
        typographic structures into something unfamiliar tactile, heavy, and
        expressive. Every glyph in Bent appears as if it has been physically
        manipulated-cut, stretched, or compressed. The letterforms carry the visual
        tension of bent metal, evoking a sense of collapse and material weight. This
        typeface resists regularity, embracing asymmetry and rupture as core design
        principles. Bent is designed for exhibition branding, large-format editorial
        layouts, and spatial typographic applications where its sculptural quality can
        take center stage. It is meant to be viewed from a distance-much like the monumental works that inspired it.
        More than a typeface, Bent operates as a graphic form: a hybrid of
        typography and object, structure and collapse. </p>
